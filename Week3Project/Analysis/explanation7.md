The route trie node was built like a normal trie node, and the route trie class was built like a regular tree which uses the route trie class. 
In the route trie node class the functions all have O(1) time and space complexity. 
In the route trie class, the functions insert and find were built like a normal trie. The insert function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n). The find function also has a O(n) worst case time complexity and a O(n) space complexity. 

The router class is like a masking class which uses the router trie functions. The add handler class has a O(n) space and time complexity. The lookup function has a O(n) worst case space and time complexity. Finally, the split path function has a O(1) time complexity and a O(n) space complexity.
